		In the spring of 1986 the TRAA formed by anglers <br>concerned with the state of the fishery in the Thames<br> River watershed, particularly the dwindling smallmouth <br> bass population in the North Thames River.

	<p class="P5">
		The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)<br> is a trout and species of salmonid native to<br> cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in<br>Asia and North America. The steelhead (sometimes <br> called "steelhead trout") is an anadromous (sea-run)<br> form of the coastal rainbow trout (O. m. irideus) or <br>Columbia River redband trout (O. m. gairdneri) that<br> usually returns to fresh water to spawn after living<br> two to three years in the ocean. Freshwater forms <br>that have been introduced into the Great Lakes and<br> migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called <br>steelhead.

<div class="fishes">
	<p class="P6">
		Adult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between 1 and 5 lb (0.5 and 2.3 kg), while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may <br>reach 20 lb (9 kg). Coloration varies widely based on subspecies, forms and habitat. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish<br> stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males.

<p class="P7">
	The scientific name of the rainbow trout is Oncorhynchus mykiss. The species was originally named by German naturalist and taxonomist<br> Johann Julius Walbaum in 1792 based on type specimens from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia. Walbaum's original species name,<br> mykiss, was derived from the local Kamchatkan name used for the fish, mykizha. The name of the genus is from the Greek onkos ("hook")<br> and rynchos ("nose"), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the "kype").
